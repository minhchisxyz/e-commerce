# React

## How to run
```bash
cd ui 
npm install
npm start
```

## Layout approach
- A navigation bar on the top, which has different categories to filter
- A list of product cards, which has the product name, price and image

## Responsiveness considerations
- Set break point at 768px (md class in tailwindcss)
- On mobile devies, the filter options is displayed when opening the menu icon
